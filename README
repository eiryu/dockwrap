Dockwrap is a small utility written in Bash designed to help building and running an application in a Docker container.

By default, Docker spawns a new container whenever the run command is used, if a container name is provided.
This tool is also able to perform dynamic DNS updates to assign one or multiple sub-domain of a zone to the IP address allocated by Docker (this works only if your containers are accessible on your network, meaning you are using a bridged interface)
